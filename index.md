"Wandering Trails" is a text-adventure style game set in a mystical forest of hidden magic. You play as a lost adventurer, trying to find their way to a safe place to rest for the night. The game begins when you come across a fork in the road. As you make your way through the forest, the story will change based on your choices. Some choices will either benefit you or others, but every choice leads to a consequence. This game includes the use of basic object-oriented programming principles.
